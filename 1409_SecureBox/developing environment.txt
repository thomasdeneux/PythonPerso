************************* INSTALLED PROGRAMS ***********************************

SOURCETREE
shared project on Bitbucket Securebox/Securebox

ANACONDA
http://continuum.io/downloads (windows installer: check 'add to path' and 'create registry entries')

This sets up python together with many packages including:
- Spyder, the programming environment
  (to work with the project SecureBox in Spyder, select 'Files > New Project':
  Spyder asks which folder to use as 'spyder workspace' -> choose the folder
  inside which SecureBox folder is sitting)
- pyCrypto (https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto) for the cryptographic functions

additional packages needed: (run .exe files, winpython package install from the control panel doesn't really seem to work)
- cx_Freeze https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=display&name=cx_Freeze&version=4.3.3

correct installation of python and Spyder can be tested by trying to execute helloworld.py
correct installation of cx_Freeze can be tested by trying to compile helloworld.py by executing helloworld_setup.py
correct installation of pyCrypto can be tested by trying to execute crypto.py

INNO SETUP
(use compiler to edit and execute securebox_installer.iss file)
